### Oh yeah, week notes. I do those! Sort-of..

It's been a while - about time I wrote a little catch-up.

### I am a people, I have a blog

After some email chat about guestbooks, I was invited by Manu to be an interviewee for his People and Blogs series:
[manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/pb-sara-joy](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/pb-sara-joy)

He encouraged me not to curtail myself too much, after I had ummed and ahhed about how long to make my responses. I had started long, then pruned back, hard, and finally added some personality back into my answers.

I decided there was some purpose to my interview - to embolden people to strike out for new career territory if the current situation isn't working. I hoped I helped someone feel like they weren't alone.

### I have been 11typilled

I don't use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Yet. But the shiny new [11ty conference](https://conf.11ty.dev/) issued a call for proposals, and I figured there was nothing to lose by submitting.

Um. And I got in, and then did the thing! It was a variation on my CSS `color-scheme` [blog post](https://sarajoy.dev/blog/color-scheme/), called "Why not both? ü§î - Light mode vs. Dark mode"

The community is lovely. And the audience was lively in chat. And so wholesome. I say I'm 11typilled because just based on the sheer force of lovely people who love using it, I can't not try it out üéà‚ù§Ô∏è
