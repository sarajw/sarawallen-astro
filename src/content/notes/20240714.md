How is it July? Halfway through July, really?

Wish the weather would perk up a bit...

### Conf-tastic times

I went to two within a month!

In 2023 I had asked around for the best 'cosy' web development / front end conferences, because I had been with my colleagues to a large one (or two, React Summit and JS Nation - held on 2 consecutive days in the same venue and sold in a single ticket deal) where I did not quite feel at home.

I had managed to meet several Mastodon contacts at the above, anyway - people who I wouldn't actually expect to see at those events. And I enjoyed a few of the talks - but it still felt weird and a bit too big.

Some of the same colleagues are considering Web Summit in Lisbon this year - or WeAreDevelopers World Congress and I'm like, nope. Exhausting. More power to them!

There were several recommendations, but these two events stood head and shoulders over the rest in terms of people singing their praises:

#### Beyond Tellerrand - Düsseldorf 13-14th May

The name of this one comes from the German phrase "über den Tellerrand sehen" meaning something between thinking outside of the box, looking beyond the horizon, and seeing further than the end of your nose - the Tellerrand meaning the edge of a plate.

I booked it before I saw the speaker list on the pure strength of recommendation, and honestly as the speaker list filled up I was unaware of many of the names, and felt unsure I had done the right thing. But I was booked! And committed to looking beyond said Tellerrand, of course, and I'm so glad I did.

This conference is broad, with speakers from design, development, research, education and the arts. Some talks were very specific, others incredibly broad, some neutral, others extremely politcal - but they all felt relevant and I was riveted.

#### CSS Day - Amsterdam 6-7th June

I didn't need to be recommended CSS Day. I WANTED to go, oh my - I'd seen it was a thing and immediately knew I was going to need to go to it.

Oh I was - well in German I would say 'begeistert' - enthralled? Rapt? Nerding out together with ~350 other people was just great. CSS Day sounds like it would be really narrow - and yes of course it mostly revolved around the cascade - BUT somehow the talks still ended up extremely varied.

I was particularly fascinated by the talks given by people who work or have worked in the W3C, thrashing out the details of how our web platform should behave.

#### The people

Talks aside though, these events were a social joy for me. I was in my element. These are my people. I came away with such warm and fuzzy feelings and a good number of new friends.

I never imagined I could work in an industry where I could get paid to attend things and meet people like this. I am very privileged indeed.
