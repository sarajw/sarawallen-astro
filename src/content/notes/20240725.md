title: Weaknote 2024-07-25 (a tab amnesty)
---

I am inspired by [Ross Wintle](https://fosstodon.org/@ross) blogging away his [open mobile tabs](https://rosswintle.uk/2024/07/old-tabs-part-2/), and [FND](https://hachyderm.io/@FND)'s [Readcently](https://prepitaph.org/wip/readcently/) (which was apparently inspired by these very Weaknotes, love how these things cycle around) - so here we go, I'm finally closing some browser tabs on my smartphone and sharing them with you!

I may add notes to some of them later - otherwise I'll just let the mostly-descriptive URLs do the talking :)
