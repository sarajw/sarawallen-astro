## Personal computer: ThinkPad E490 laptop
- got used to track points via old Dell Latitude D410 
- have since only bought budget ThinkPads because TrackPoint
- good take-apartability, upgradability
- great maintenance manuals
- second hand market for laptops and parts
- lots of enthusiasts!

## Work laptop: 14" 2021 M1 MacBook Pro
- it was that or another ThinkPad with Linux
- thought I may as well try out MacOS ðŸ¤·

## Dell Ultrasharp U3821DW monitor
- provided by company
- huge! Like two monitors stuck together
- handy integrated USB-C hub

## Trackball Logitech mouse
- got sore fingers so now tiring out my thumb instead
- replaceable balls! Currently using a glittery pink one
- satisfying to clean out, like the old days

## Keyboard Keychron K4
- got numkeys!
- the arrow keys are unfortunately 'hidden' by feel, have had to add bumpy stickers to them 
- Keychron also sold an awesome 200+ key pink dolch keycap set
- brown switches, not too noisy
- put little damper rubber rings under keys, because they were still a bit clacky

## Mackie EM-91CU microphone
- recommended by Zach Leatherman before 11tyconf
- because the ThinkPad mic was potato quality
- now sounding smooth as silk ðŸ˜…

## Bean bag wrist rest
- wasn't sure if needed
- easy to stow away or make thicker or thinner

## IKEA LÃ…NGFJÃ„LL chair 
- simple
- I don't sit still for all that long 
- surprising tip mechanism!

## Foot roller as footrest
- I'm short ðŸ˜…
- plantar fasciitis meant it helped to keep feet active and massaged
