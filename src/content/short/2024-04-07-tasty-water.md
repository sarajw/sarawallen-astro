title: Tasty water
---
I swear water tastes sweeter when my body needs it.

I'm sort of terrible at being thirsty? If I'm hot and have been using lots of energy, I totally crave cold water - but otherwise I often just don't notice any thirst.

Until I drink - and if I'm dehydrated - water tastes amazing!
