title: It's just... fun?
---
Someone on Mastodon asked Kev Quirk why people build personal websites, when social media profiles already serve that purpose well.

[Kev replied in blog form](https://kevquirk.com/blog/why-have-a-personal-site-instead-of-social-media).

[So did Juha-Matti](https://hamatti.org/posts/why-personal-site-rather-than-social-media-presence/).

I'm like, it's just fun!

I've been extremely online since 1998/9. In that time I've made my own websites, closed them down and retreated into a more private web (was safest while I was a teacher of teenagers for a period), used the likes of blogger and tumblr, and finally in 2020/1 started rebuilding my very own public web presence.

I started building again to aid my getting a job in web development, but it's since become much more personal and a lot less like an online portfolio.

It feels right to have my own home online, built by me, for me. I do it because I can and because it's fun :)
