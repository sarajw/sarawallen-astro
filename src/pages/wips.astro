						<p>A lot of hobbyist websites are not very accessible, but, many of them actually do want to be more inclusive, while also finding themselves bewildered by the advice and resources available out there. This is my attempt to be helpful. Very much a work in progress!</p>

						<h2><a href="https://codepen.io/sarajw/pen/xxBGmRZ">No class CSS</a></h2>
						<p>This started off with an idea about being very lightweight - and then I added colour themes and then I got stuck for far too long styling the range slider. Definitely needs a revisit!</p>

						<h2><a href="/basic">Basic website</a></h2>
						<p>This was imagined to be a new redesign of this site, or a less slidey tabby version of this one. Ideally it would be more elegant,somehow.</p>
						<p>I'm not sure I'm managing it, it's very much on the back burner! I love the display font though: Ships Whistle &lt;3</p>

						<h2><a href="/blog/scrolling-tabs/">The making of</a></h2>
						<p>I'm attempting to write up how I made this site's gimmick work. But, I started improving how it's done as I went along, meaning I really ought to incorporate said improvements back into this site, and lost momentum ðŸ¤¦</p>

						<h2><a href="https://color-scheme.yay.boo">Slide deck</a></h2>
						<p>I gave this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lye56NHGtLA">talk on CSS property <code>color-scheme</code></a>, and tried to share the powerpoint presentation afterwards - which had a horribly inaccessible accessibility mode. So I started making my own.</p>
						<p>There's a nearly invisible button at the bottom left, which toggles a document vs. slideshow mode.</p>
						<h2>Update! <a href="https://whynotboth.sarajoy.dev/">Slide deck mk II</a></h2>
						<p>I managed to refine and extend this a little - it's very janky so I'm unsure it's finished - but it worked well to present <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ4XjLeaKH4">at the 11ty conf</a>, and the <a href="https://whynotboth.sarajoy.dev/#doc">reading version</a> can be found via the same button or by adding /#doc to the end of the URL.</p>

						<h2>Copyable websites</h2>
						<p>I had this idea that the code involved in making a simple website could be commented well enough to guide people into tinkering with it more, so they learn fom the ground up. I have made two attempts at this:</p>
						<p><a href="https://linkfae.netlify.app/">LinkFae</a> - a sort of fancy linktree type site, inspired by <a href="https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/">James Hoffman's website</a>.</p>
						<p><a href="https://codepen.io/sarajw/pen/oNVzvgg">Website boilerplate</a> - a proto-blog style starter page.</p>
